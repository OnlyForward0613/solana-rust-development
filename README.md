# Solana program - basic

This is a Rust & Solana tutorial repo.
You can learn solanan smart contract development using Rust by following the below steps.
Before starting tutorial repo, please check their README.md files first.


## Step1: Learn Rust programming.
- You will learn Rust programming in [here](/rust)
- Each day has at least 3 Rust code tutorials.
- You can check your understanding with fixing/completing test.rs file.


## Step2: Hello World Solana Smart Contract Development.

- You will build solana smart contracts & dApps by following this [tutorial](https://solhack.com/courses/building-solana-smart-contracts-dapps-with-james-bachini/)
- The final source code is [here](/solana/helloWorld)


## Step3: Escrow Solana Smart Contract Development.

- You will build a bit complex solana smart contract program here by following this [tutorial](https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/)
- The final source code is [here](/solana/escrow)
- Before leaving this tutorial, plese check if you understand [these](/escrow/program/doc.md) fully.


## Step4: Anchor Escrow Program
- Using Anchor framework, We're building Escrow Programing again here. But we modified [escrow](https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/) program a bid differently here. You can check details [here](/anchor/anchor-escrow-master/README.md).
